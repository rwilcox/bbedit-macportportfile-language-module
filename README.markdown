Introduction To This Project
=============================

This is a BBEdit Codeless Language Module that provides good highlighting for developing MacPort portfiles in BBEdit.


Installation
=============================

Copy diff.plist into ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/). If no such folder exists, you may create one. After installing a new language module, you will need to quit and relaunch BBEdit in 
order to use it.


Areas For Improvement
===========================

  * The MacPort syntax was based off an older version of MacPorts, which may have added syntax and keywords since the creation of this module
